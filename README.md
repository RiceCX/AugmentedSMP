Have you ever felt something was missing from your SMP world? Are players losing interest in your server because there is just simply nothing to do or the game is just too hard? This plugin provides an abundance of tweaks and configuration options that will enhance your server's gameplay such as a leveling system, login rewards, difficulty tweaks, and many more. (A full list can be viewed [here][more-tweaks])
